# TextRPG

TextRPG is an experimental text based RPG run in a terminal. The app is written in Python, but there are plans to convert it to Javascript for running in a web bowser.

### Usage
To run the game, open 'main.py' via a terminal within VSCode, or any other application capable of running python files.

### Planned Features
- Command based combat
- World travel travel via command options while outside of combat encounters
- Rework for Javascript
